                I started my programming journey when I started learning about the python computer programming language.
                I started learning on February 2023. Since then, I have finished learning about basic python, then continued 
                learning when I enrolled as a senior high school student. <br><br>
                I have now finished learning introduction and on my way to finish intermediate java. I do not so enjoy web-based development 
                but I can create simple pages because I learned how to use HTML and little CSS. <br>
                I hope to generate more experience from programming to be more trained and ready for careers. I also am interested on learning more 
                computer languages. I would say that I am satisfied of my academic abilities because it is stable.
